<h3>Random Observations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    BART escalators - some BART station exits have only one escalator (19th St. Oakland is an example).  The natural question is should the escalator go up or down. Energy-wise, it should always go up, since its harder for people to go up a flight of stairs than to go down. But Catch-the-train-wise though, it probably makes sense for the escalator to go down because people are always rushing for the train.  Of course this is dependent on the time of day.

    Spiral Staircases - ever notice how spiral staircases go clockwise? (meaning if you were at the top looking down on someone walking up the stairs, they would appear to go clockwise).  I think it's because most people are right-handed and the convention is people walk on the right-side.  This way, you can hold onto the side rail as you walk.

    The most common cliche is high school architypes (nerds, jocks, etc.)  This is in tons of examples in film, tv, books, articles, etc.

    If 42 is the answer to life, then think about what ten times the answer to life is.
