<h3>Prisoner's Dilemma Mass Computer Simulation Challenge</h3>
<p>
  First read up on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a>.  Basically, if two people cooperate they both win moderately.  If they both screw each other, they lose.  If one screws the other, the screwer wins big, but the victim loses big.

  Now read about <a href="http://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/1998/fall/CS105/Project/node4.html">Axelrod's Tournament</a>.  This is obviously just a simplified computer simulation, but it does have strong implications for living.  Namely, don't be a dick.  The all-defect strategy didn't win. Also, revenge is okay.  The poor-trusting fool strategy didn't win.  But if you in turn dish out revenge, keep it proportional: tit for tat wins the day.
