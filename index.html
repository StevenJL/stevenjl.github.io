<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>
  Welcome to my digital presence.  I'm gonna use this to share random stuff.
</p>

<h4>Short Bio</h4>
  <p>
    I was born in <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taishan'>Taishan, China</a> in 1982 and immigrated to Oakland, CA in 1985.  I'm really interested in math, science, philosophy, and recently, computer programming.  In my free time, I like having deep discussions with my friends, traveling with my wife, riding my bike around Lake Chabot, running the fire trails of the Oakland hills, and playing computer games.
