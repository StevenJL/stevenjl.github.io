<h3>Family History</h3>
  <p>
    Both my mom and dad are from <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taishan'>Taishan County</a> in southeastern China.

    My mom's grandfather came to California at the turn of the century where he made his fortunes as a cargo transporter.  He went back to Taishan and became a wealthy land owner.  His youngest son, my grandfather, was an opium addict and gambler<sup><a href='#fn1' id='ref1'>1</a></sup>, who squandered most of his father's fortune.  But as luck would have it, when the communists took over, he escaped their persecution as he was no longer an 'oppressive land-owner' but a poor proletariat.  Reminds me of a <a href='http://www.thedailyzen.org/2011/12/zen-koan-maybe.html'>zen story</a>.

    Due to her family's poor situation, my mom dropped out of school after the 6th or 7th grade and instead went out to work. I think she worked construction-type jobs (ie. mixing cement, laying brick, etc.) to support her family. After emigrating to the United States, she continued working as a seamstress, hotel maid, and mail carrier to support her family (me and my dad, who wasn't working) as well as her family in China.  She's literally the hardest working person I've ever met and a real inspiration for me.

    My paternal grandfather (dad's father) was a wealthy merchant in the city of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou'>GuangZhou</a>.  I was told he was an extremely hardworking man who built his fortune from nothing.  Unfortunately, when the communists took over, he was persecuted and eventually died under the duress of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struggle_session'>struggle sessions</a>.
  </p>
    My dad went to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University'>Sun Yat Sen University</a>.  He eventually worked as some sort of loan officer for the government.  Basically, he would approve/reject government capital for public projects. Unfortunately fell under a similar fate as his father and was sent to a labor re-education camp in northeastern China for 15 years.  The communists targeted him solely based on his background, namely, he was the son of a wealthy merchant.  Being a loan officer also probably didn't help.

<sup id='fn1'>1. I know this is an unflattering and gross simplication.  So to be fair, I was told he was a really smart guy and was very nice to my mom.</sup>
