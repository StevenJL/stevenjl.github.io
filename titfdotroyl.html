<h3>Today is the first day of the rest of your life.</h3>
<i>Personal essay on my first pyschedelic experience, written circa 2006</i>
<p>
During the summer of 04, I became interested in pyschedelic drugs. Tom, one of my best friends, had done magic mushrooms a few months ago and raved about its beauty. "It changed my life", he said. I had been in a rut, most of it due to family issues. I trusted Tom. Not only was he incredibly smart, but he was genuine and honest. His voucher made the thought of doing shrooms very appeaing. "Alright," I said. "Let's do it." A few years prior, the very thought of doing psychodelic drugs would have repulsed me. Drugs were dangerous and would ruin your life, I was told. But recently, I began developing a skeptical view of the establishment.  I started noticing discrepancies between what the establishment (an amalgamation of the government, media, academia, pop culture, etc.) told me and what I really saw. I came to explore the possibility that they don’t really doesn't know what’s best. And even if they did, maybe they weren't looking out for my best interest, but simply their own.

And what about drugs? Maybe the government is lying (or exaggerating) about drugs. At the very least, it seems awfully hypocritical to criminalize methamphetamines and then repackage them in the form of a drug called adderall and give to kids with ADD. Now, don't take this to mean all illegal drugs are good. I don't doubt heroin and crack are terrible drugs and rightly illegal. But marijuana, shrooms and LSD isn’t heroin and crack. Not chemically nor in effect. It may be the case that the government is just throwing a blanket over all drugs (which the pharmaceutical firms don't promote and sell already) as bad. Maybe there are good drugs and bad drugs.

Anyway, Tom and I are responsible drug users. We always did our research. What exactly is this drug? How long does it last? Is there a lethal dosage? What are the long term effects? How many people have done it? What precautionary measures should we take? I was very careful because quite frankly, I was scared.  I did my research on shrooms, and it passed my "good drug" criteria. It's a naturally occurring mushroom. It has been used for thousands of years by various indigenous peoples of the Americas for their coming-of-age rituals, or whatever. There is no lethal dosage. It's non-addictive. It leaves no long term physical damage. In fact, the only possible danger arises from the warped perceptive state causing the user to do something he might regret later: <cliche jumping off building urban legend>. But this was highly unlikely. People who do these crazy things are mentally unstable in the first place. I seem pretty stable… I think.

The trip would last 6-8 hours, so we needed a whole day. We cleared a Saturday the week right before finals. The plan was to go on the Berkeley campus, have a picnic, eat some sandwiches and take the mushrooms. It was a surprisingly beautiful day for December. The mushrooms were dried and really ugly-looking. They tasted even worse. Tom was bitching about the taste but I had grown up on herbal medicines, so this was nothing.

Nothing really happened the first hour after eating them, aside from slight nausea. I remember we were sitting on the grass outside Gianini Hall. I was listening to Bjork on my ipod. I began to worry that I wasn't gonna feel it. Maybe I took too little. But slowly it took over. Then it hit me: The world is incredibly beautiful. I was looking at the trees, the grass, the people, the sky... I was breathless. It was beauty like I'd never seen before. Well... maybe not. I remember when I was a little kid, around 4 years old, I looked up at the blue sky and gazed into the illusionary azure fabric that covered our world and went into a trance. I was having that same feeling again, only 17 years later. I felt born again; rediscovering the beauty in this world.

Tom and I picked up our backpacks and started walking. We first went into VLSB and looked at the dinosaur bones. They looked alive and amazing. I couldn't believe all the times I came to VSLB to study, walking past these bones, completely oblivious to their beauty. Shrooms makes you feel a kid again. For 6 hours, you feel as if you had been born that day. You really begin to understand what they mean when they say: "Today is the first day of the rest of your life."
</p>
<p>
We walked around some more on campus and eventually sat down on some steps. I kept thinking: "The world is so beautiful. Life is so beautiful. What's there not to be happy about?" It's true. I call shrooms and LSD life-affirming drugs because they help you appreciate life. This is different from drugs like heroin and crack, which people take to escape from life. You really can't get addicted to shrooms because it's not so much the altered state of mind that you crave, but it's the thoughts and revelations that makes you happy. And you can always store these thoughts in your memory. When you get depressed, recalling these memories can bring a smile to your face.
</p>
<p>
Later on, we walked back to Tom's house. Ben, Tom's roommate, was there. He asked me how the shrooms were and I really couldn't explain. It's just so hard. I told him, "It's a life-changing experience" and some other stuff. At this point, my mind shifted gears. I had been appreciating the beauty of the outside world. Now, I embarked on a journey within. A "Who am I?" type of quest. There were moments of complete nothingness in my mind: A zen-like state where my mind was reduced to a blank mental process running in a vacuum. I forgot who I was. What I was. Where was I. I lost myself completely, and rebuilt my inner mental space from first principles.

I wanted to tell Tom what I was experiencing. When I looked at his face and saw an empathetic smile, I knew he understood. I didn't need to say anything.
I began learning how my body worked again. I started walking and jumping. I did some push-ups. I drank water. I touched the walls. I looked in the mirror and didn't recognize me. I had been a bodiless mental process for so long, I forgot I inhabited a human form. I thought of all the people who've had psychedelic experiences before me. I felt connected to all these people through this experience. It was like a spiritual underground.
</p>
<p>
When I came down, the 6 hours felt like a lifetime. I felt like a different person. Shrooms really changes you in a profound way. They call it a "trip" because it really feels like you went on a trip that lasted a lifetime. After doing shrooms that day, I took my finals and aced all of them. I ended up making the Dean’s list that semester.
</p>
<p>
After doing psychedelic drugs, I went through a phase where I wanted to talk to other people who had done them. I wanted to compare experiences and see if they had the same spiritual transformation I had. But really, you just can't. It's impossible to transfer a continuous experience like an LSD trip through a medium of discrete words. Even as I write this, I'm disappointed at how much of the experience is lost in words. I guess the real loneliness is that we're ultimately limited in our expression. Today, if I met someone who has done psychedelic drugs, I would just say: "Cool." They know how it is. Words are unnecessary.
