<h3> What is Zen?</h3>

I think many intellectually curious people will ask 'what is Zen?' the first time they hear about it.  They'll probably be frustrated to hear that there really
is no answer to that question; that it's a paradoxical question, really. As Alan Watts explained, when you think you understand what Zen is, you would have lost
the point. And when you throw your hands and give up any hope of ever understanding what Zen is, that's when you truly understand it.  This "beginner's mind"
(referencing the famous Zen book by Suzuki) is paradoxical but very important in Zen.

Now that's a very frustrating answer for the intellectually rigorous types.  It sounds like a cop-out, really.  But interestingly, it's this very intellectual frustration
that is so appealing to the intellectually rigorous types. We chase that which eludes from us.  In that sense, what if the mystique around Zen is simply s an evangelical tool for Zen (and Bhuddhism, in general) for the
intellectually curious, rigorous, and displined types. In fact, Zen lore makes
reference to this exact concept with the parable of "Jiang Ziya and the straight fishing hook".  In that parable, an old sage named Jiang Ziya is fishing with a "straight fish hook", so
basically a needle, not to catch fish but to catch people's attention ("Hey, old man, why are you fishing with a straight hook?").  In which, he was really fishing for people.
And he found one who he taught worthy of mentoring.

Well, now that you've got my attention, Zen.  You've hooked me in with your "straight fish hook".  What is it that you would like me to do? Oh, be a good person.
