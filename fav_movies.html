<h3>Favorite Movies</h3>
<p>
  Here's a list of movies that I not only enjoyed watching but made a lasting impression on me over the years.
</p>
<p>
  I think the person who really influenced the way I viewed films was Roger Ebert.  As a kid, I religiously watched "Siskel and Ebert" every Saturday afternoon.  Funny thing is I often enjoyed his review of the film more than the film itself.  Anyways, I really enjoyed Ebert's analysis of films.  It wasn't just entertainment but an art form and a rich medium of communication.  I wasn't that big a fan of Siskel though.  I never thought he was as insightful as Ebert.

<h4>The List (in alphabetical order)</h4>

    <b>Adaptation</b>
    <p>
      Very nice recursive movie: Basically, the script Charlie Kaufman is writing in the movie is the script for the movie itself (more or less).  There are a few hints this is the case.  For example, when Charlie Kaufman (the Nicholas Cage character) asks Robert McKee for advice, McKee responds to "just wow them at the end"(paraphrasing).  And that's exactly what happens in this movie at the end.  It was a cerebral self-study that devolves into drugs, sex, car chases and swamp alligator attacks.

    <b>The Big Lebowski</b>
    <p>
      Or "Zen and the Art of Bowling".  At surface alue, it's a hilarious movie with memorable dialogue and great characters. 
      But I see it as an incarnation of the parable where a man has interesting adventures, problems resolve themselves,
      and he returns to his simple: In this case, bowling and White Russians.

    <b>Crumb</b>
    <p>
      A haunting documentary about 60s underground comic-book artist Robert Crumb.  Interweaves his art and his life beautifully, with one reflecting the other.  His work is absolutely beautiful and terrifying, as is his family life.

    <b>A Serious Man</b>
    <p>
      A great spiritual film against the backdrop of 1960s small town Jewish community life.  One of best films about god and spirituality, IMO.

    <b>There will be Blood</b>
    <p>
      An engaging period piece focusing on the rivalry between two intensely ambitious characters: An oilman and an evangelical.
      They use each other for their own gains, but a serious rivalry develops as they both ambitiously lust for
      power/wealth.  One through oil, and the other through religion.

    <b>Slingblade</b>
    <p>
      I love the main character, Karl Childers. He is not mentally retarded as it first seems.
      His technical prowess at fixing machines shows at least above average cognitive skills.  The meaningful friendships he develops reveals his emotional depth. 
      The sacrifice he makes for those he loves unveils a disciplined and well-aligned moral compass. He is simple, but not stupid at all.
      His only abnormality is his bizarre speech pattern and mannerisms, which probably resulted
      from childhood neglect and over a decade of institutionalization.
      And even so, he still lead a life of zen-like simplicity.  Memorable film with a memorable character.  Truly one of my personal favorites.

    <b>Trainspotting</b>
    <p>
      Great story, dialogue, and characters, but really awesome soundtrack and great music editing that moves the story along.  
      The "choose life" monologue at the end really seals this film as one of my all-time favorites by expounding a serious philosophical question.  Camus once said 
      "The only serious philosophical question is whether or not to commit suicide." This films presents a third option: Whether or not to be a heroin addict.

    <b>The Up Series</b>
    <p>
    This is a documentary series which follows the lives of a dozen or so British children from age 7 til 56. As such, it is 
    the longest spanning documentary series I know of.  Namely, the first release was in the 1950s when they were age 7 and 
    the last release was in the 2000s, when they were 56.  By following these individuals through most of their lives through
    one of the most tumultuous periods in human history, we gain a penetrating into glimpse into the modern human condition.  
    That alone is why this is probably the most important films ever made.  My wife's coworker told us about this movie and 
    just from the premise alone I knew I had to watch it and it did not dissapoint.  This is perhaps the noblest usage of the film medium.
