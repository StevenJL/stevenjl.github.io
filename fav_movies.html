<h3>Favorite Movies</h3>
<p>
  Here's a list of movies that I not only enjoyed watching but have changed the way I thnk about the world.

  I think the person who really influenced the way I viewed films was Roger Ebert.  As a kid, I religiously watched "Siskel and Ebert" every Saturday afternoon.  It's funny though, cause I enjoyed watching his review of the film more than the film itself.  Anyways, I really enjoyed Ebert's analysis of films.  It wasn't just entertainment but an art form and a rich medium of communication.  I wasn't that big a fan of Siskel though.  I never thought he was as insightful as Ebert.

<h4>The List (in alphabetical order)</h4>

    <b>Adaptation</b>
    <p>
      Very nice recursive movie: Basically, the script Charlie Kaufman is writing in the movie is the script for the movie itself (more or less).  There are a few hints this is the case.  For example, when Charlie Kaufman (the Nicholas Cage character) asks Robert McKee for advice, McKee responds to "just wow them at the end"(paraphrasing).  And that's exactly what happens in this movie at the end.  It devolves into drugs, sex, car chases and swamp alligator attacks.

    <b>The Big Lebowski</b>
    <p>
      Or "Zen and the Art of Bowling".  At face value, it's a hilarious movie with memorable dialogue and great characters that subtely touches on zen philosophy.

    <b>Crumb</b>
    <p>
      A haunting documentary about 60s underground comic-book artist Robert Crumb.  Interweaves his art and his life beautifully, with one reflecting the other.

    <b>The Up Series</b>
    <p>
      This is a documentary series which follows the lives of a dozen or so British children from age 7 til 56. As such, it is the longest spanning documentary series I know of.  Namely, the first release was in the 1950s when they were age 7 and the last release was in the 2000s, when they were 56.  By following these individuals through most of their lives through one of the most tumultuous periods in human history, we gain a penetrating into glimpse into the modern human condition.  That alone is why this is probably the most important film every made.  My wife's coworker told us about this movie and just from the premise alone I knew I had to watch it and it did not dissapoint.
