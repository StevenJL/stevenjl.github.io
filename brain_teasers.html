<h3>Brain Teasers</h3>
<p>
  Here's a collection of memorable brain teasers I've collected over the years.  Some of them only require arithmetic and common-sense.  Others require more mathematical maturity.  I'll describe the pre-reqs before each problem.

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Add all the numbers from 1 to 1000  without a calculator</h4>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Prerequisites:</emphasis> Just grade school arithmetic, as Gauss was able to figure it out using that.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss'>Gauss</a>, the greatest mathematician ever, figured out how to do this when he was just in grade school.  His teacher wanted to keep the class busy and told them to add all the numbers from 1 to 1000.  Gauss was able to quickly find the sum using this trick.  And it wasn't through rain-man skills but through a really clever trick he invented on the spot.  What was his trick?

    <h4>Symmetry: Place down a quarter.</h4>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Prerequisites:</emphasis> In theory, none.  Even a child who knows what a circle can solve this.
    </p>
    <p>
      You and a friend are playing the following game on a perfectly circular table (hint: the radius of this circular table is irrelevant).  You take turns placing down quarters on a perfect circular table such that no two quarters overlap and no quarter falls off the table.  The first person unable to place a quarter down losses.  There is an unbeatable strategy to this game (ie. if someone does this, they always win).  What is that strategy?  Think about whether or not you should always go first or last?

    <h4>Submarine on the Number Line</h4>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Prerequisites:</emphasis> If you've taken discrete math and you get this one, you're pretty smart.  If you've never taken discrete math and you figure this one out, you're a genius.  Start studying math and try to win a Field's medal.
    </p>

      A submarine is traveling on the number line at constant velocity.  We don't know its initial position and its velocity, but we do know its initial position is an integer and its velocity is also an integer.  You have a cannon at your disposal that can hit any point on the number line instanteously, but you can only fire it at most once per second. <b>Come up with a firing algorithm for the cannon that will guarantee to eventually hit the submarine.</b>  For example, an algorithm can be "fire at 0 when t=0, and every second fire at the next integer greater than it." Of course, this algorithm won't work if the submarine starts at -2 and has a velocity of -1, cause you'll never hit it!

    <h4>Magic Card Trick Done with Math</h4>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Prerequisites:</emphasis> Only grade-school math required.  But knowing algorithms certainly wouldn't hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      You and your friend are doing a magic trick.  You start with a standard 52 card deck and pick five cards at random and reveal four of them one at a time to your friend.  Your friend will always be able to figure out the fifth card based solely on the four cards you revealed.  Note this trick isn't based on sleight of hand or conveying secret messages (ie. if you wink once its a red card, if you wink twice its a black card).  All the information about the fifth card is encoded in the first four cards.  How do you do this?

    <h4>Guess This Vector</h4>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Prerequisites:</emphasis> Linear Algebra
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm thinking of a vector of positive integers of length 100 (though the length is arbitrary).  If you give me another vector, I will tell you the dot product of your vector and my vector.  Your job is to figure out what my vector is.  The naive solution you may have learned from linear algebra is that you'll give me 100 vectors (and hopefully they're linearly independent), I give you a 100 dot products, and we get a system of 100 equations and 100 variables, which we can solve with matrix inversion.  But what if I told you there was a way for you to figure out the vector with only <b>two dot product calculations</b>?  How would you figure out 100 unknowns with only two dot product calculations?

    <h4>Guess This Polynomial</h4>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Prerequisites:</emphasis> High school algebra
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm thinking of a polynomial with positive integer coefficients and unknown degree. You may ask me to evaluate the polynomial at only two different values.  How can you determine the coefficients of this polynomial with just two evaluations?  HINT: As you may have noticed, this puzzle is exactly the same as the previous one.
