<h3>Brain Teasers</h3>
<p>
  Here's a collection of memorable brain teasers I've collected over the years.  Some of them only require arithmetic and common-sense.  Some require more mathematical maturity than others.  I'll describe the pre-reqs before the problem.

    <h4>Add all the numbers from 1 to 1000 in 30 seconds without a calculator</h4>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Prerequisites:</emphasis> Just grade school arithmetic, as Gauss was able to figure it out using only those tools.
      <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss'>Gauss</a>, the greatest mathematician ever, figured out how to do this when he was just in grade school.  His teacher wanted to keep the class busy and told them to add all the numbers from 1 to 1000.  Gauss was able to find this sum in under a minute.  And it wasn't through rain-man skills but through a really clever trick he invented on the spot.  What was his trick?

    <h4>Submarine on the Number Line</h4>
    <p>
      <emphasis>Prerequisites:</emphasis> If you've taken discrete math and you get this one, you're pretty smart.  If you've never taken discrete math and you figure this one out, you're a genius.  Start studying math and try to win a Field's medal.

      A submarine is traveling on the number line at constant velocity.  We don't know its initial position and its velocity, but we do know its initial position is an integer and its velocity is also an integer.  You have a cannon at your disposal that can hit any point on the number line, but you can only fire it at most once per second. <b>Come up with a firing algorithm for the cannon that will guarantee to eventually hit the submarine.</b>  For example, an algorithm can be "fire at 0 when t=0, and every second fire at the next integer greater than it." Of course, this algorithm won't work if the submarine starts at -2 and has a velocity of -1, cause you'll never hit it!
